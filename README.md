# Working :

I've worked on :

- Pico 8 (Training project): discover the Pico 8 tool and succeed in making a mini game in a team of 3. My classmates and I worked on making a mini adventure game where a cat wanders in space and must retrieve a golden kibble! You can go see it in the <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-pages/projet-collectif-pico8">repo</a> or at this address: https://projet-collectif-pico8.vercel.app/
- Dataviz (Training project): this project aims to familiarize learners with using an API and displaying data on a web page. We therefore went through a bootstrap template in order to save time and focus on the display of data within web pages. You can consult the <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-pages/Projet-collectif-Dataviz">repo</a> or follow the following address: https://dataviz-sncf-98q3.vercel.app/
- Browser extension (Training project): we used the manifest V3 version of Chrome extensions to make a small extension in pop-up format. You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-pages/projet-collectif-extension-de-navigateur">repo</a>

I'm currently working on :

- Social Network (Training project) : this project is finished but I want to finish some features and redesign the content. This project was done at 6 using Apache2, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin and PHP. The goal was to create a social network in order to connect users to each other, we started on the theme of board games. You can watch the <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-pages/projet-collectif-reseau-social-php">repo</a>.

- Wine Cellar: this one is my big one. The project is to create a mobile application coupled with a web interface. I want my user to be able to access their wine cellar directly in their phone. Some applications already exist but I want to add my own product to the offer list already present. I aim to do a big project that will help me get my diploma and that could perhaps lead to business creation. For the moment I have just worked on the interface, made a first model on Figma and followed a tutorial in order to start experimenting with the Kotlin language. As I am looking for a work-study program, I am putting the project on hold in order to focus on my first languages and find a company that will want to welcome me and collaborate with me. In the meantime you can see a first part of the project <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-pages/Wine_cellar">here</a>.

- Node.js app: as part of a training exercise, with a friend we want to go further in the project and want to create a small API using Node.js. The goal is that the client-side user enters a sentence, our client-side code sends the request to our server, which enters it into the database. Another feature will be that the customer presses a button and a random phrase from the database will be transmitted to them.

Future projet :

- Travel blog: I want to make a small travel blog to tell about my different stays in European capitals. I want to achieve it with the Svelte framework.
