# Working :

**Project Experience**

During my tenure at Ada Tech School, I was involved in several collaborative projects, enhancing my teamwork and technical skills. My projects ranged from small teams of 3-4 to larger groups of up to 10 members, each focusing on diverse technology stacks. I kickstarted my journey with a project developed in LUA, honing my foundational programming skills. Progressively, I ventured into web development, utilizing plain JavaScript and PHP to create dynamic projects. Recognizing the importance of modern frameworks, my team and I transitioned to more sophisticated technologies to refine our applications, a strategic move aimed at boosting our internship prospects.

**Current Endeavors**

Parallel to my studies, I'm passionately working on a unique initiative designed to bridge the gap between wine enthusiasts and businesses. This project, akin to a social network, aims to unite users around their shared love for wine. I'm responsible for developing a versatile backend infrastructure to support both a web and a mobile application. The web platform will offer full accessibility across devices.
