# Welcome on my profil ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guillaume PagÃ¨s, and I am a recently graduated web developer from Ada Tech School. I am eager to apply my skills and collaborate on innovative new projects. During my training, I had the opportunity to contribute to the 1Village project by the Par le Monde association (GitHub link: https://github.com/parlemonde/1village), where I put my knowledge into practice in a real-world context.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise by learning cloud technologies with AWS, preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to enhance my ability to build scalable and efficient applications.
