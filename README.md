# Working :

I've work on :

- Pico 8: discover the Pico 8 tool and succeed in making a mini game in a team of 3. My classmates and I worked on making a mini adventure game where a cat wanders in space and must retrieve a golden kibble! You can go see it in the repo or at this address: https://projet-collectif-pico8.vercel.app/
- Dataviz : this project aims to familiarize learners with using an API and displaying data on a web page. We therefore went through a bootstrap template in order to save time and focus on the display of data within web pages. You can consult the repo or follow the following address: https://dataviz-sncf-98q3.vercel.app/
- Browser extension: we used the manifest V3 version of Chrome extensions to make a small extension in pop-up format. You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-pages/projet-collectif-extension-de-navigateur">repo</a>.
