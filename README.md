# Welcome on my profil ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guillaume PagÃ¨s, and I am in the process of transitioning into a web developer career. Currently, I am studying the theory at Ada Tech School, and I am applying my knowledge in practice for the 1Village project of the Par le Monde association (GitHub link: https://github.com/parlemonde/1village).

What I learn at Ada Tech School and in my free time :

# Working :

## I've worked on :

I worked on various projects during my time at Ada Tech School. These projects typically involved teams of 3 to 4 people, with one of them even being a larger team of 10. We used different technology stacks for these projects. The first project was developed using the LUA language. As for the others, we initially used plain JavaScript and pure PHP. Later, we enhanced these projects by integrating specific frameworks. This transformation was done to elevate our skills and improve our chances of securing internships with companies. You can explore these projects in the "Repositories" section!

## I'm currently working on :

In my free time and during my studies, I'm working on a project aimed at connecting individuals and businesses in the world of wine. Think of my project as a social network where everyone comes together around a shared passion: the world of wine! To bring this project to life, I will be building a backend that will be shared between a web application and a mobile application. The website will be fully accessible through both desktop and mobile-responsive versions. As for the mobile application, it will initially complement the web application, making it easier for users to input information about their wine bottles.
